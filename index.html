      <p>As I finish my first semester here at UNO, I wish I could travel back in time and prevent myself from making some mistakes caused by a lack of preparation for University. While I can't force you to do anything, I can tell you some things that required some figuring out on my part.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p>1. Scott Housing is not identical.</p>
      <p>Besides the changes in area, different amenities are at different locations. Scott Village is the oldest, has the least built-in amenities, with laundry and mail service being at a different building. Maintenance is required as the dorms may be falling apart in some areas, but the price reflects this. Scott Crossing is the newest, has the most amenities, and includes The Campus Grind, a built-in coffee shop, inside of its walls. This is reflected in its price. Scott Court lies somewhere in the middle, and is the closest to the Aksarben area.</p>
      <p>2. Balancing the time between classes is a fine art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Whether you drive or take the shuttle, thanks to weather, shuttle breaks, line switches, and parking issues, it's best to keep classes that are distant in geography distant in time as well. I've found 40-45 minutes to be the acceptible minimum amount of time for me to comfortably get to my next class. However, a time of 1-2 hours ends up creating a "Waiting time", in which there isn't enough time to relax or get anything done, but too long to simply wait around for your next class. Keep all of this in mind.</p>
      <p>3. Don't procrastinate, and reach out to your teachers for help</p>
      <p>You are the masteer of your schedule at University, and late assignments and missing classes tend to vary in terms of consequences based on the professor. Many policies, such as late work, extension periods, and due dates are to a professor's discretion. Their mercy, is also not bound to policy as much as it is in high school. Teachers are human too, and talking to them for either academic help or due to events out of your control is completely valid!</p>
      <p>4. Make friends and get involved!</p>
      <p>University isn't just about the classes you take, but about the connections you make and the social circles you find yourself in. Making the most of university is being able to leverage all of these things in tandem to improve your life in all aspects.</p>
      <p>5.&nbsp; You are important. Prioritize yourself.</p>
      <p>Don't break yourself trying to appease some arbitrary assignment or restriction. Take breaks, rest, get enough sleep, and success will follow your self-care, not from your lack of it. Depression and anxiety tanks your grade far more than not finishing an assignment completely</p>
      <p>UNO has mental health services available at the UNO Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Use their services, you matter and your health is paramount to your success.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
